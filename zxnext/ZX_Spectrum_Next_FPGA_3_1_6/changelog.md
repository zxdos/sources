|3.00.XX|Allen Albright  |Refactor (Many Changes)  |  
|3.01.00|Allen Albright  |First Public Release (Day Zero Update)            |
|3.01.01|Allen Albright  |<b>ULA</b> : Interrupt time in 48K and 128K video frame was off by one cycle<br/><b>ULA+</b> : Byte read from port 0xff3b incorrectly indicated ula+ was not present<br/><b>AUDIO</b> : Attempt to double volume on 3.5mm jack and internal speaker<br/><b>AY</b> : Implement differences in how AY and YM respond to register reads<br/><b>PORT DECODE</b> : Bit 31 of nextreg 0x89 and 0x85 determines whether the port decodes are soft or hard reset<br/><b>SCANLINES</b> : Change weights to 0, 12.5, 25, 50<br/><b>COMPATIBILITY</b> : Port decoding style now determined by current video timing rather than static machine type; active ports no longer limited by machine type<br/><b>STICKS</b> : Sinclair 1 and Sinclair 2 joystick types were reversed in the hardware<br/><b>HDMI</b> : Audio stream made signed instead of unsigned<br/><b>NMI</b> : Function key activation now cancels nmi generation so that minimum press time of one second is no longer needed<br/><b>MEMORY</b> : Nextreg 0x8e added to more quickly perform traditional bankswitching normally done through ports 0x1ffd, 0x7ffd, 0xdffd<br/><b>SLU 6 & 7</b> : Blending updated to be more useful<br/>* Nextreg 0x68 bits 6:5 control which of ula or tilemap layer blends with layer 2<br/>* SLU 6 = (U or T)S(T or U)(B+L) colours clamped to [0,7]<br/>* SLU 7 = (U or T)S(T or U)(B+L-5) colours clamped to [0,7]<br/>In both cases U or T only appear independently if they are not involved in blending     |  
|3.01.02|Allen Albright  |<b>DMA</b> : Ports 0x6b and 0x0b (new) both address the dma. When port 0x0b is read or written the dma is placed in z80-dma compatibility mode. When port 0x6b is read or written the dma is placed in its native zxn-dma mode.  Nextreg 0x06 bit 6 which used to select dma mode has been removed.<br/><b>PORT DECODE</b> : Nextreg 0x85 and 0x89 have bit 25 added to enable dma port 0x0b<br/><b>EXPANSION BUS</b> : Nextreg 0x8a bit 4 allows propagation of port 0xff io cycles to the expansion bus.<br/><b>AUDIO</b> : Nextreg 0x06 bit 6 chosen to select a new classic audio mode where beep and tape noises are directed to the internal speaker exclusively and other audio is directed to hdmi and the 3.5mm jack.<br/><b>AUDIO</b> : Another adjustment of the internal speaker volume and a different treatment for the classic audio mode that allows beep noises to be louder.  |
|3.01.03|Allen Albright  |<b>AY</b> : Fix bug where the envelope period counter was not reset when register 13 was written.<br/><b>AUDIO</b> : Another adjustment of internal speaker volume with total volume increased at the expense of increased likelihood of clipping and classic mode audio made a little more quiet.<br/><b>EXPANSION BUS</b> : (trial) Introduce a ROMCS rom replacement feature enabled by bits 6 and 2 in nextreg 0x80. External devices can continue to assert /romcs but the next can replace the 16k external rom with divmmc banks 14 and 15 to allow custom code to be written to support external devices more seemlessly.<br/><b>EXPANSION BUS</b> : Nextreg 0x8a defaults to all port propagation disabled on hard reset. Port 0xfe was propagated by default prior to this change.<br/><b>MEMORY</b> : Nextreg 0x8e no longer changes mmu 6/7 when the ram bank is not changed.  |
|3.01.04|Allen Albright  |<b>DMA</b> : The 16-bit byte count now read in the correct endian order through the read register.<br/><b>MULTIFACE</b> : Fix numerous errors in the implementation of the mf128 and mf48.<br/><b>STICKS</b> : Correct md pad state machine that was reading some input at the wrong time.<br/><b>STICKS</b> : The joystick connectors can now be configured as an i/o device with 1 output and up to 12 inputs. Three modes are supported including bit-bang where the state of the output bit is controlled by the program, clock where the output bit is driven by either a slow or a fast clock, and uart where one of the next's two internal uarts can be redirected to the joystick connector. Details can be found in documentation for port 0x37 and nextreg 0x05.<br/><b>STICKS</b> : Button A on md pads now generates an UP direction for non- md pad joystick modes.<br/><b>COMPATIBILITY</b> : Pentagon 512K support is added that is activated when the video timing is set to Pentagon and when bit 7 of port 0xdffd is set to 1.  In this mode, port 0xdffd is ignored in banking and instead bits 7:6 of port 0x7ffd extend bits 2:0 of the same port to select a 16K bank.<br/><b>KEYBOARD</b> : It is now possible to read the state of the new composite keys directly instead of indirectly through the key membrane. Details under nextreg 0x68, 0xb0, 0xb1.  |
|3.01.05|Allen Albright  |<b>DISPLAY</b> : A vertical line offset has been introduced in nextreg 0x64.  The display continues to use vertical line positions with 0 indicating the first row of the pixel area generated by the ULA.  However the copper, line interrupt (nextreg 0x22,0x23) and active video line (nextreg 0x1e,0x1f) have their Y positions offset by this new register.  When line 0 of the ULA is reached, the Y position of these other units is set to the vertical line offset.  As an example, an offset of 32 would have the copper line position at 32 when the display draws line 0 of the ULA and the copper line position of 0 would correspond to 32 lines earlier where the sprites and tilemap have their Y=0 position.<br/><b>COMPATIBILITY</b> : Bit 7 of port 0xdffd, which selects Pentagon 512k mode, can only be changed when pentagon timing is not active.<br/><b>COMPATIBILITY</b> : All port contention has been disabled for the +3.<br/><b>I2S</b> : I2S master mode has been removed with nextreg 0xa2,0xa3 affected.<br/><b>MOUSE</b> : Mouse dpi and button swap controls have been introduced in nextreg 0x0a.<br/><b>STICKS</b> : Joystick io mode can now be operated the preferred way with io mode selected via port 0x37 before the io mode is enabled on the joysticks via nextreg 0x05.<br/><b>STICKS</b> : Joystick io mode now reads from one joystick only, selected by bit 4 of port 0x37.  This was necessary to allow reliable 2Mbps transfer rate in uart mode.  The program can still change the active joystick via bit 4 of port 0x37 at any time but for uart mode this should be done during a quiet time in communication.  Any output always appears on pin 7 of both joystick connectors.  |
|3.01.06|Allen Albright  |<b>COMPATIBILITY</b> : Pentagon 512, pentagon 1024 and zx profi memory mapping modes added with control through new i/o port 0xeff7 and nextreg 0x8f.  These mapping modes can be enabled or disabled at any time and no longer depend on pentagon video timing being active to take effect.<br/><b>STICKS</b> : Correct MD Pad algorithm so that it doesn't toggle the select pin for a few cycles into the rest period.<br/><b>MULTI-CORE</b> : Physical SRAM address pins A10 and A18 were swapped to place FPGA configuration pin HSWAPEN on A18.  This restricts SRAM corruption to odd multiples of 256K between core boots.  Core sram initialization can safely be done in even multiples of 256K and the initialization program running in standard spectrum memory does not reside in the safe areas so that it does not reduce the amount of initialized sram available to cores.  Nextreg 0x04 ram bank has been expanded to seven bits from five so that the entire 2MB of memory is reachable for the sram initializer, making half the zx next's memory accessible to initialization for cores.<br/><b>MULTI-CORE</b> : Move CPU A0 to A19 so that the 16-bit physical sram interface can be used by the core.  Even addresses use D7:D0 of the physical sram data bus and odd addresses use D15:D8 of the physical sram data bus.  Initializing memory for other 16-bit cores should be made simpler.<br/><b>DISPLAY</b> : All palettes now have two layer priority bits for possible future developments.<br/><b>AUDIO</b> : HDMI audio returned to previous unsigned volume levels as some displays were incapable of rendering full signed 16-bit audio properly.  |

|2.00.20|Allen Albright  |Sprites: New module allows all 64 sprites to display on a line  |
|2.00.21|Allen Albright  |Sprites: Fifth attribute byte is present if bit 6 of the fourth attribute byte is set<br/><br/>  H N6 0 X X Y Y Y8<br/><br/>  4-Bit Patterns<br/>   H = 1 means the sprite uses 4-bit patterns<br/>  N6 = 0 chooses the top 128 bytes of the 256-byte pattern otherwise the bottom 128 bytes<br/><br/>  Sprite Scaling<br/>  XX and YY affect scaling in the X and Y directions<br/>  00 = *1 16 pixels<br/>  01 = *2 32 pixels<br/>  10 = *4 64 pixels<br/>  11 = *8 128 pixels<br/><br/>  Y8 is the ninth bit of the Y coorindate to allow wrapping on the Y axis<br/><br/>Sprites: Nextreg 0x15 bit 6 = 1 changes sprite priority so that sprite 0 is on top<br/>Sprites: Nextreg 0x15 bit 5 = 1 enables clipping in over border mode<br/>Sprites: Writing to port 0x303B with bit 7 set adds an offset of 128 to the pattern index  |

|2.00.26|Allen Albright  |Tilemap: Obey SLU order in border area<br/>Sprites: Lock bit in nextreg 0x34 moved to bit 4 of nextreg 0x09 so that nextreg 0x34 can behave exactly like io port 0x303B when the two are tied  |
|2.00.27|Allen Albright  |ULANext: Paper and border colour for all ink mode now comes from the fallback colour in nextreg 0x4A<br/>DMA: Add Z80-DMA compatibility bit in nextreg 0x06.  When set, the transfer length is increased by one<br/>DMA: Implement the STATUS register returning 00E1101T where E=0 if the entire block has completed transfer at least once and T=1 if at least one byte has been transferred<br/>DMA: Implement new commands RESET 0xC3, RESET PORT A TIMING 0xC7, RESET PORT B TIMING 0xCB, READ STATUS BYTE 0xBF, REINITIALIZE STATUS BYTE 0x8B, INITIALIZE READ SEQUENCE 0xA7.  These are still being tested.<br/>Sprites: Implement a second relative sprite mode - the unified sprite.  Relative sprites are rotated and mirrored around the anchor.<br/>Tilemap: Make 512 tile mode a separately indicated mode in nextreg 0x6B instead of only being available when the ULA is disabled.<br/>Tilemap: Add bit to nextreg 0x6B to force the tilemap over the ULA.<br/>ZX48: Correct ram contention for 48k spectrum machine type.<br/>ULA: Fix Timex hi-res offset by one pixel bug.  |
|2.00.28|Allen Albright  | Numerous changes.  |
